# Simple-Algebraic-Equations-Solver-Using-Genetic-Algorithm

This project is based on "Writing Text Using Genetic Algorithm", which I wrote it to demonestrate the very basics of genetic algorithm. See it here: https://github.com/AGhaznawi/Writing-Text-Using-Genetic-Algorithm

Solving algebraic equations using genetic algorithm requires representing unknown variables as genes in a candidate solution chromosome. It also requires an objective function where the difference between left hand side (LHS) and right hand sid (RHS) of the equation are minimized. This means that F(x1, x2) â€“ a = 0, where x is the equation variables and a is the RHS.

The program solves for this equations:
- x^3 = 27
- y^3 * x = 24
- x * y * z^2 = 96
but it has also been tried on different sets of equations.
